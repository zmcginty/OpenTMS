This project is an open-source transcranial-magnetic-stimulator, including some code for VERY SIMPLE controls for pulse-firing system and hopefully charge-controller (coming later), but mainly it's for documentation of the system design, janky schematics, some pictures of circuits, some pictures of coil-designs and possibly much more.

To be clear, this is NOT a legitimate medical device and should not be seen as an alternative to going to get legitimate TMS treatment. Any treatment with this janky, built-in-my-garage version of TMS isn't gauranteed to work, or do anything as I have no way to verify that it works such as an MRI. This is a dangerous device involving energy levels more than high enough to stop your heart, kill you and do alot of damage.

I plan on putting both designs of pulse-generators in here and documenting each. 

Components Common to each Pulse Generator:
    TMS-Coil: I primarily use two types of coils; single coils, and figure-of-eight coils. Both single and fig-8 coils can be either single-layer or multi-layer flat coils with no core (use air as core). I basically just used the same general architecture in these designs from various research papers and what little information released by tms-coil manufacturers. As I've transistioned to higher-speed pulse rates and higher pulse energies I've found it necessary to have active cooling for the coils and have tried a few different methods. One of my favorite designs is similar to the CloudTMS coil using hollow copper tube (sold for air-conditioning systems), insulating the tube with some kind of heat-shrink(I've found PTFE heat-shrink works quite well because of thin wall after shrink, withstands high-temp, and is doesn't allow coil to move as much compared to regular heat-shrink, but requires pretty high temp to fully shrink). So I get some 4mm OD, 3mm ID copper tube in 5m sections, get some 4.5mm 4:1 PTFE heat-shrink in bulk. To get any kind of long section of heat-shrink onto such a long tube takes creativity, patience and compressed air to create an air-cushion between the copper tube and heat-shrink to easily push it on. Then I'll use a janky, custom coil-winding jig I made to wind a coil in either single layer or multi-layer(Note multi-layer is just winding randomly around a bobbin, not stacking multiple single layers... I'm not that fancy yet, but they seem to work well). You'll want to put something like string plastic wire inside the tube to keep it from collapsing during the first few windings, and pull it out after winding's done. Hold coils together with some tape while you pot them in some epoxy; This helps greatly with general stability of coil and noise, it keeps the coils in place when they want to fight eachother. I've tried holding coils together with hot-glue which does work, but those coils are very loud which doesn't inspire much confidence increasing power.. 
    These coils with hollow copper tube are meant to have cooland pumped through them to cool them, for a long time, I used mineral-oil as a coolant which is pretty thin for oil, but much thicker than water, so I needed about 150-200psi to push enough through the small ID of the coil to keep it at a reasonable temperature (below 40c). Depending on the energy levels going through the coil, you may also need a water-chiller and heat-exchanger to further cool the oil before going to the coil. Recently I found that diaphram pumps are electrically insulated (to some extent) through the diaphram from the fluid they're pumping, so I found that using a diaphram pump and water seems to work very well to cool these hollow copper coils, though there is some more risk there in terms of the water coolant being at high-voltage. 

Charging Circuit: I've used the same general janky, open-loop charging circuit for a while; this consists of mains power going into a variable-transformer which goes to a microwave-oven-transformer to step it up to higher voltage, which is then rectified with a full-bridge rectum-fryer. This rectified DC then goes to the large discharhe capacitor which is discharged through the coil by a high-side switch (either latching-SCR or non-latching-IGBT).

Cooling Microwave-Oven-Transformers: When running this system at higher-frequencies and higher energy levels (ie. 10hz pulses at ~2000V for a 100uF cap), I've found the system will draw about 14amps AC at 120v (going into the variable-transformer) At this current, the MOT(Microwave-Oven-Transformer) will get pretty hot, I don't know the max temp they can run at (core or winding), so I prefer to keep the primary-coil below 70c. To do this at high currents, I've built a low-pressure mineral-oil cooling system which circulated oil in a custom-made enclosure (MOT is insulated from walls of enclosure) through a heat-exchanger getting cooled by the same water-chiller. This has kept the MOT at a reasonable ~50c running at the energy levels mentioned above.

Design #1; SCR type Pulse-Generator.
    This is the first design of pulse generator I built and it is great for handing rediculous energy levels at consistent frequencies/patterns such as the standard 5 & 10hz protocols used in early depression-treatment protocols. However I ran into limitations when I wanted to try more complex pulse patterns such as "Theta-Burst) which is a short burst of 50hz pulses, repeating at 4-5hz. The SCR (Silicon-Controlled-Rectum-Frier) or thyristor, is a switchable diode which are latching. So for the task of discharging a capacitor through a coil; they completely drain the capacitor, but because of this steady decrease of current, the flyback effect from the TMS coil isn't too bad.

Design #2; IGBT type Pulse-Generator.
    The IGBT based pulse generator allows much more control of energy through the treatment coil. And since IGBT switches aren't latching like the SCR, you can turn them on then back off in short duration pulses, only partially discharging energy storage capacitors. This allows doing pulse patterns such as "Theta-Burst" as mentioned above. However, since you're shutting off the switch as current is flowing through the TMS-coil you're going to have a great deal of flyback to deal with so as not to fry IGBTs with this potentially high reverse voltage spike (This was how I fried many IGBTs). For flyback you'll need one hell of a flyback diode accross the TMS coil, as well as snubber capacitors accross the IGBT(s) to handle the spikes caused by parasitic inductance of wires/cables/bussbars and such. You'll want to get some high-voltage differential oscilliscope probes to measure important voltages, such as voltage accross the IGBT. So that as you're testing and tuning the system, you can stay within the limits of the switch you're using.
